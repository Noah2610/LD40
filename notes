Building max width: 32px

Border sections should always have border to the left (in image)
Border sections @end_point_heights values should both be the same (:left == :right)

in sections config:
	@biomes = [:left_biome,:right_biome]
		or
	@biomes = [:biome]

	# Order is important, left to right (x)
	@build_levels = [
		{ x: 64, y: 64 },
		{ x: 128, y: 128 }
	]


NEEDED TEXTURES:
	Border sections for every possible @end_point_heights values and biomes
